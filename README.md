# Iris Flower Classification

This project is part of the CodeAlpha Internship (Data Science domain).
The objective of this task is to classify Iris flowers into different species
using machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
Given measurements of iris flowers such as sepal length, sepal width,
petal length, and petal width, the goal is to predict the species of the flower.
The three species are:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Iris dataset, downloaded from Kaggle.
It contains 150 records with four numerical features and one target label (Species).

## Approach
1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
2. Removed unnecessary columns.
3. Performed basic data analysis and visualization.
4. Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. Trained three classification models:
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
6. Evaluated the models using accuracy score.
7. Compared model performance using visualizations.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Results
All three models performed well on the Iris dataset.
Support Vector Machine achieved the highest accuracy among the models.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic machine learning classification workflow
using Python and Scikit-learn. The Iris dataset is well-structured and suitable
for understanding fundamental classification concepts.
